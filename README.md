Your character - a wizard - travels through a dangerous tower with various levels full of monsters in order to become the master-wizard of the tower. 
For this he has to successfully pass all levels and win against the end-boss.
There is a time-limit to go through each level of the tower. 

(For the demo version of the game, only one level of the tower is available. More will follow soon.^^)

The player has the following stats: Health & Strength
The Opponents (monsters and other wizards and witches) have the same stats as the player: Health & Strength

The Level, Playername and Playerstats are displayed besides the dungeon screen. 
The timer for the respective level is displayed there as well. 

When the Player meets an Opponent, they fight with each other. Their respective strength is deducted from the other partie's health. 

There are also items (potions) scattered around, which will improve the player's stats when the player picks them up.

Item have to vanish when picked up.
Opponents have to vanish when they lost the fight. 

If the player has 0 health the player loses the game. 
If the countdown reaches 0 the player also loses the game and is allowed to restart the current level or go back to the start screen.
